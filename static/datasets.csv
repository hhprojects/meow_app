cover letter typically accompanies each resume you send out.
your cover letter may make the difference between obtaining a job interview or having your resume ignored, so it makes good sense to
devote the necessary time and effort to writing effective cover letters.
a cover letter should complement, not duplicate, your resume.
its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resume and add a personal touch.
a cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression.
find out more of the differences between a resume and a cover letter.
there are three general types of cover letters: the application letter which responds to a known job opening (review samples) the
prospecting letter which inquires about possible positions (review samples) the networking letter which requests information and assistance
in your job search (review samples) your cover letter should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each
position you seek.
do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!).
effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences
(remember, relevance is determined by the employer's self-interest).
the letter should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the position.
keep in mind that your cover letter doesn't need to be long - a page is plenty.
here's information on how long a cover letter should be.
bottom of form the following application letter format lists the information you need to include in the job application letter you send with
your resume.
use this as a guideline to create customized application letters to send to employers.

12763627,Software Developer,WEB DEVELOPER,"was to migrate the existing application which was developed in MS-Access to a web based application by implementing security and adding additional business rules. 2) DEBTS (Daily Equity Based Tax Solution): DEBTS is a tool which is used to calculate employee tax based on certain parameters (medical, social security tax factor). It is developed for UTC USA and deals with all UTC employees' daily equity tax. UBS will place a flat file each day in SFTP with all transactions performed by the employees of UTC. The typical flat file contains employee id, country code, tax details etc. DEBTS tool will connect to SFTP and downloads flat file to perform the validation rules, at last tool will decide the record status (there are 3 statuses as Valid, Exception and Pending). User can login to the system and can review the exception records. And also user can rectify the exceptions to move the exception record to valid records and send the funding files to ADP. 3) Supplier Portal Supplier Portal is designed in SharePoint 2010 to collaborate with their authorized suppliers. Supplier Portal is a merge of seven legacy Pratt and Whitney existing applications into a single portal. The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data that can be uploaded into each column.

Projects: Atlas: Description: This project is all about requesting, scheduling the tutoring sessions. There are three roles tied to application they are Tutee, Tutor, and Scheduler. A tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he/she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through Availability Grid and Tutor submits availability. A scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring. Also, there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project. The other piece of this project is automated emails through Scheduled task which runs every day. Responsibilities: Created a Availability Calendar Grid. In grid each cell represents time (1 hour span) and day of the week. Clicking on the cell toggles the availability. Automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different database(Worked with data warehouse team in order to get that data) Developed C# Console Application for Scheduled email task. Got rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled. Created Class libraries out of the main project to access the database which can be used by both Console Application for Schedule task and web application. Integrated Open Source HTML text editor CKEditor into the website. Used jQuery for filtering, sorting and search the listview, JavaScript for clientside validations. Used role based authorization for various pages. The goal of the project to refractor the old application with new templates and replace the assemblies. Adding functionalities to upload pdf files. Responsilities: Created separate Login page for Administrator and Students. Used Active Directory (AD Group) to restrict other department Students. Developed a web interface for Administrators to upload the pdf files into database which can be viewed by students. Updated the entire application by using new Visual Studio 2013 template which make use of Bootstrap CSS by changing the master pages. Modified the structure of database to login. Used Redgate SQL Compare to copy the data from database from dev server to test sever. Replaced the old ADN Utilities assemblies with new DoIT Utilities assemblies. AppInventory: Description: The goal of the project to allow the admins, managers, scrum masters of the organization to keep track various applications which includes their developed, ongoing and future projects. For every application there are application parameters which includes App Structure, Remedy group, User Departments etc. and each application has different version. For each version the parameters are Prod, QA, test URL, DCL, Database, platforms, framework used to develop application, UAT dates etc. Scrum Masters can estimate the length and cost to build the application (Project Estimator) based on number of developers, Sprint length, weeks of UAT etc which they can share with clients.
